# Deep_treatment_recommender
Code for submitted PKDD paper  
We are continuously maintaining and updating this repository  

The codes include two different parts:
+ Synthetic patient record generation algorithm
+ RNNs for activity recommendation

We are not able to provide the authentic data as it is allowed by the protocol of our project.

Alternatively, we provided some synthetic desensitized patient records generated using the algorithm we proposed in this paper.
